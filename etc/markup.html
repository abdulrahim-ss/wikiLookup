<b>Look up anything in Wikipedia from your cards, inside your cards!</b>

<b>Overview</b>
WikiLookup is an Anki add-on that lets you select any word/expression/sentence in your cards, hit a keyboard shortcut, and get a popup that gives you an explanation/definition of the expression with a visual - just like the popups you get when hovering over hyperlinks in Wikipedia articles - without the hassle of opening the browser and searching!

<b>About the add-on</b>
This add-on was created to make it easier for Anki users to stay focused while learning by letting them look up words and expressions while still inside Anki. It was created to help my sister study for her medical exams!
Special thanks to <a href="https://github.com/kleinerpirat" rel="nofollow">@kleinerpirat</a> for the inspiration from his <a href="https://ankiweb.net/shared/info/1840818335">Anki Tooltips</a> add-on (I stole half of its code ;P). Check his amazing add-on out!

<b> NOTE:</b>
Currently, you need to choose the language wiki in the config settings for the add-on to be able to query the correct wiki and find the relevant article from which data for your Lookup expression will be retrieved. This is a Wikipedia API limitation.
However, I am already working on several solutions so that, in future releases, WikiLookup can automatically look up the word in the relevant language wiki.
However, this is tricky to achieve, and I can't promise it will be delivered with a hundred percent certainty. Although, it is more probable than not that it is hopefully coming.
One of the solutions I am currently considering will unfortunately cost money (will probably need a monthly subscription to a service). If the case is true that this is the only viable solution, I am afraid I will not be able to deliver. However, if I get enough money that covers the fees for this add-on for a long enough period in the future from the donations below, I'll be more than happy to implement this particular solution.

<b>Donation:</b>
This is my first attempt at creating an Anki add-on. It is still in its early form and has much room to improve. I'm still pretty much an amateur.
If you like this add-on and would like to see it become faster, smarter, and more useful, please consider <a href="https://ko-fi.com/abdulrahimss">donating</a> on ko-fi to support the development of this add-on, as well as any other projects that I might be doing in the future.
Any form of support is much appreciated!

I will probably be uploading the entire project to GitHub and open-source it once I get on to cleaning up the code. Feel free to check it out and make use of it when it's available.
Thanks for using WikiLookup!
